\section{Executive Summary}

\paragraph{Name of system / Purpose and scope: \\}
This note provides an overview of the BaBar solenoid that will be re-purposed as the ECCE detector solenoid, documents the method by which the in-kind value of the solenoid is estimated. It documents simulations of the magnetic field and the estimated forces on the solenoid coils in the asymmetric ECCE configuration as well as studies of the shape of the magnetic field on the performance of the dual-radiator RICH (dRICH). 

\paragraph{Describe Technology Choice, with reference to Yellow Report: \\}
The studies in the Yellow Report considered both a low-field (1.4-1.5T) and high field magnet (3.0T). 
%What is different, same, improved?}

\paragraph{Expected performance of system versus Yellow Report requirements: \\}
The BaBar solenoid provides the 1.4T magnetic field to the experiment. The performance of the tracking and momentum resolution in the lower magnetic field is described in the ECCE tracking systems analysis note. 

The field provided by the BaBar solenoid is sufficiently projective that it does not cause a significant smearing of the dRICH ring from the gaseous radiator, and therefore trim coils to shape the magnetic field are not required.  

%Could just be a table.}

\paragraph{Limitations if any for EIC physics: \\}
The BaBar taken by itself does not imply any limitations for EIC physics.  The performance of the different detector subsystems (tracking, etc.) are described in additional ECCE working group notes. 
% Include at least one key performance plot and/or links to key performance plots.
